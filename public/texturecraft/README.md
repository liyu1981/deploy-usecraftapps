## Made in TextureCraft

Both pieces below were textured with TextureCraft's procedural materials and smart materials (no
textures or models from anywhere else) and path traced on the GPU by `texturecraft-cli render`.

## Why TextureCraft

- **Familiar.** The layout, tools, menus, panels and shortcuts texture artists already know: texture
  sets, a layer stack with per-channel blending, masks and generators, smart materials, the tool
  shelf, the 3D and 2D views. You already know how to use it.
- **Fast.** A tiled, copy-on-write texel engine on every CPU core and a wgpu viewport (Vulkan,
  Metal, DX12, WebGPU). Mesh maps bake on the GPU about 12× faster than on the CPU, Rendering mode
  path traces about 25× faster, and 8K texture sets stay responsive while you paint.
- **Seamless.** Brush stamps live on the 3D surface, so strokes flow across UV seams, and the
  camera's visibility keeps paint off the back of your model.
- **Robust.** No panics in shipped code, every command tested with hostile input, unlimited undo
  from copy-on-write snapshots, and lossless `.tcraft` projects.
- **Open.** glTF/GLB, FBX, COLLADA, USD, Alembic, OBJ, PLY and STL in; PNG, JPEG, TGA, TIFF, BMP,
  WEBP, EXR and HDR textures out at 8, 16 or 32 bits, with UDIM tiles; OBJ, textured GLB and USD
  mesh export. Every material, environment, brush alpha and built-in mesh is procedural.
- **Agent-native.** Every menu item and tool is a command you can drive from the CLI, a JSON
  control channel or an **MCP server**, so Claude and other agents can paint, bake and export the
  way a person does.
- **Everywhere.** One codebase for the desktop apps and the same UI in the browser.

The full list of what's in it is in [`docs/features.md`](docs/features.md).

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/texturecraft
cd texturecraft

cargo run --release -p texturecraft                          # desktop app (opens a sample project)
cargo run --release -p texturecraft -- model.glb             # a new project from a mesh
cargo run --release -p texturecraft -- --control 7878        # + JSON control channel
cargo run --release -p texturecraft-cli -- mcp               # MCP server (stdio)
cargo run --release -p texturecraft-cli -- new builtin:crate crate.tcraft --sample
cargo run --release -p texturecraft-cli -- render crate.tcraft crate.png --samples 256   # path traced
cargo run --release -p texturecraft-cli -- export crate.tcraft textures                 # headless export
cd apps/texturecraft-web && trunk serve                      # web build
cargo xtask ci                                               # fmt, clippy, tests, layering, wasm
```

You need Rust 1.95 or newer. The app opens with a baked sample project; **File ▸ New project** starts
from a built-in mesh, a project template or your own mesh file (UVs are generated if it has none).

Japanese, Chinese and Korean interface text uses the fonts of
[storytold/craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts) where it has them, an optional
build input (releases always use it): `CRAFT_FONTS_DIR="$PWD/../craft-fonts" cargo run --release -p texturecraft`
(an absolute path). Without it, the desktop app uses the installed system fonts.

### Use it from Claude Code and other agents

Register the MCP server with Claude Code, giving it the folders it may read and write:

```sh
claude mcp add texturecraft -- /path/to/texturecraft-cli mcp --read-root /work/project --write-root /work/project
```

To drive the running app instead, start it with `--control 7878` and bridge to it:

```sh
claude mcp add texturecraft-app -- /path/to/texturecraft-cli mcp --bridge 7878
```

The details are in [`docs/control-protocol.md`](docs/control-protocol.md).

## Status

TextureCraft is under active development. [**ROADMAP.md**](ROADMAP.md) has the parity estimate by
area, the remaining work and what's next.

**Where we are (2026-11-01):** we estimate about 93% of a texture artist's daily workflow works end
to end, weighted by how much of the day each area carries: importing meshes, texture sets and UDIM
tiles, the layer stack with masks, effects and smart materials, every painting tool, baking, the PBR
viewport and Rendering mode, export presets and templates, and the full menu set. The interface
speaks English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Chinese and Korean;
[localization-parity.md](docs/localization-parity.md) has the details. The scores are self-assessed
from our code against public documentation.

**What's missing:**
- hardware ray tracing in Rendering mode;
- pen tilt (the windowing layer doesn't report it yet);
- Alembic files in the older HDF5 container, and Alembic animation (the first sample is read);
- a native-speaker review of the translations;
- the first signed release on every platform.

**Where we're going:** the first release, v0.1.0, on every platform; then the remaining rendering
and file format gaps. The ranked list is in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

**Workspace:** `crates/{core, texel, geom, compose, bake, paint, formats, engine, render, automation, ui-egui}`
and `apps/{texturecraft, texturecraft-cli, texturecraft-web}`. The egui frontend is its own crate, so
the UI can be swapped without touching the engine; [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)
explains how it fits together.

Agent and contributor rules (clean room, the asset policy, no panics in shipped code, quality gates)
are in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), and [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) explains how releases
are built, signed and published. Every bundled asset is listed with its licence in
[`ATTRIBUTION.md`](ATTRIBUTION.md).
